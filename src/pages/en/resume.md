## Platform Engineer

[**Shine**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shine-tools) · Full-time 📍 Paris, Ile-de-France, France _(Currently)_

As the backbone of the technical service, I work on three main fronts:

- The first one is the "**Infrastructure**" aspect, where my responsibility lies in ensuring the stability and scalability of the infrastructure. This involves implementing Terraform and migrating from AppEngine to CloudRun.

- The second front is "**Core services**," where I focus on functionally meeting the needs of product-oriented tech teams. I design a scalable permission system and an authentication system.

- The third front is "**Developer Experience**," where my goal is to design and maintain tools that make the lives of developers at Shine easier. This includes creating a CLI to reduce cognitive load and designing code generation tools (TS -> JS).

_November 2019 - November 2022 · 3 years 1 month_

Implemented CI/CD on GitLab using hosted runners on EKS (AWS) to automate testing, linting, vulnerability checks, and deployment to the cloud. Dockerized the entire infrastructure and set up a RabbitMQ cluster to transition the architecture to Event-Driven Design. Created an internal tool for developers to launch the required microservices for their work "à la carte" (based on Docker Compose v2). Implemented alerting, analysis, and BI tools such as Sentry, Elasticsearch, and Metabase, all hosted on our private cloud.

## DataOps

[**Continental**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/continental/) 📍 Toulouse, Occitanie, France

_April 2019 - November 2019 · 8 months_

The mission was to implement a machine learning model to process videos collected by a vehicle fleet in compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including blurring faces and license plates.

To provide more context to this project, my task was to develop a Cloud-based solution (AWS) to handle the massive amount of videos stored on S3 and utilized by different feature teams within CDSF for their respective

projects.

Together with another mathematician colleague, we trained an AI based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model using a dataset containing different typologies of faces and license plates, resulting in a ready-to-use model for other teams.

This mission concluded with a patent filing for the solution we developed, based on image independence without temporal correlation. ([Patent Link](https://data.inpi.fr/brevets/FR3099841))
